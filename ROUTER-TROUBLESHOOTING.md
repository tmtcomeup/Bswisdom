# React Router Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem Overview: Blank Page / Routing Issues

This guide addresses an issue where React Router is failing to render routes correctly, resulting in blank pages. The problem particularly affects nested routes (e.g., `/resources/homework/guides/exam-strategies`).

## Quick Fix Options

1. **Use the Debug Console**: Open `/debug-console.html` to interactively test routes
2. **Try the Minimal Test**: Visit `/minimal-test.html` for a simplified working version
3. **Run the Debug Tools**: Execute `start-debug-tools.bat` to launch all debugging utilities

## Root Causes & Solutions

### 1. Nested Route Structure Issues

**Problem**: Nested routes may not be correctly defined in the router configuration.

**Solution**: The fixed implementation uses a flatter route structure. Instead of deeply nested routes with many parent/child relationships, we define routes with explicit paths.

```jsx
// AVOID deeply nested structure like this:
{
  path: 'resources',
  children: [
    { 
      path: 'homework',
      children: [
        { path: 'guides', 
          children: [
            { path: 'exam-strategies', element: <Component /> }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

// USE flatter structure like this:
{
  path: '/resources',
  element: <Component />
},
{
  path: '/resources/homework',
  element: <Component />
},
{
  path: '/resources/homework/guides/exam-strategies',
  element: <Component />
}
```

### 2. Component Dependencies

**Problem**: Components with imports that cannot be resolved cause the entire route to fail.

**Solution**: The fixed implementation uses simplified components with minimal dependencies. For production, ensure all imports resolve correctly.

### 3. Context Provider Issues

**Problem**: Missing context providers (e.g., CartContext) can cause blank screens.

**Solution**: Ensure all required providers wrap the RouterProvider, and consider using error boundaries to catch and display errors.

### 4. Route Export/Import Issues

**Problem**: Circular dependencies or incorrect exports in route files.

**Solution**: Ensure route files have clear export statements and avoid circular dependencies.

## Debugging Tools Included

1. **Route Tester** (`route-tester.html`): Tests all application routes and reports success/failure
2. **Debug Console** (`debug-console.html`): Visual interface for navigating and debugging routes
3. **Debug Router** (`src/debug-router-with-panel.jsx`): Entry point with detailed route logging
4. **Minimal Test** (`minimal-test.html`): Simplified implementation to verify React Router works

## Steps to Fix Your Own Routes

1. **Simplify Route Structure**: Start with a flat structure and build up complexity
2. **Add Console Logging**: Insert console logs to trace where rendering fails
3. **Test Routes Incrementally**: Build up from basic routes to more complex ones
4. **Check for Errors**: Look for error messages in the browser's developer console
5. **Verify Component Rendering**: Ensure each component renders correctly in isolation

## What Was Changed in the Fix

1. Created simplified components without complex dependencies
2. Implemented a flatter route structure
3. Added detailed error handling and fallbacks
4. Created debugging tools for visual inspection
5. Included a basic version that works without any dependencies

## For Complex Scenarios

If the issue persists, you may need to:

1. Look for runtime errors in imported components
2. Check for CSS or styling issues hiding content
3. Verify all paths are correct (case-sensitive even on Windows)
4. Inspect component lifecycle and effect hooks for errors

## Recommended Route Structure

For complex nested routes, we recommend:

1. Use absolute paths instead of relative ones
2. Keep route definitions in a single file when possible
3. Use layout components with `<Outlet />` for shared UI
4. Implement proper error boundaries around route components

Remember that React Router v6 handles routes differently than previous versions, so ensure your implementation follows current best practices.

## Need More Help?

If you're still experiencing issues after trying these solutions:

1. Run the debug tools and share the console output
2. Check the browser network tab for failed requests
3. Try a minimal reproduction in a separate project
4. Visit the React Router documentation for more guidance
