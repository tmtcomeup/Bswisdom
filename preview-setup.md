# Website Preview Setup

## Background
The website is built using Vite and React, which requires a local server to preview. To make this process easier, we'll implement the following solution:

## Implementation Plan

1. Create an easy-to-use batch script that will:
   - Automatically start the preview server
   - Show the website at http://localhost:3000
   - Display clear instructions for use

2. Create a desktop shortcut for quick access
   - Point to the batch script
   - Add an appropriate icon
   - Name it "Preview Website"

3. Usage Instructions
   - Double-click the shortcut to start the preview
   - Open your browser to http://localhost:3000
   - Close the command window when done

This setup will make it much easier to preview your website without needing to run manual commands each time.
